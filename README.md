# CryptnCode
CryptnCode is basically an app which is responsible for developing security systems using algorithms and cyphers to encrypt sensitive data. In this app two algorithms are used: Morse code algorithm and cryptography. Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequence of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes (. / -).  Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques of secure communication. It is about constructing and analysing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages.
